# Introduction-to-Programming-the-ATmega328P-Microcontroller-Lab-1-
In this lab you will become familiar with the Atmel ATmega328P hardware and programming process.

The C-language program shown below is written so that it will cause two input pins (PD3 and PD4) to be monitored continuously and reflect those states to two other pins (PD6 and PD7, respectively) which have LEDs attached. The actual LED states in relation to switch states are described in Part 2.

Part 2 (circuit): All necessary parts will be given to you by the TAs. Passive components (resistors, capacitors, diodes, oscillators, etc.) are available in the lab. Parts needed: ATmega328P minimal circuit components (ATmega328P chip, Breadboard, 16MHz crystal oscillator, 22pF capacitors (2), 10k立 resistors (1), Connector wires, 5V Power supply, 220立 or 330立 resistors (2), 10k立 resistors (2), Switches (1 pushbutton or a row of DIP switches), LEDs (2), Multimeter.
